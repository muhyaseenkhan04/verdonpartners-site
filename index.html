          <h2>Search for asset-heavy, safety-critical operations</h2>
          <p>
            Averdon Partners is a specialist executive &amp; technical search firm built around aviation, aerospace and complex engineering. We sit on the spine between operations and the boardroom – starting with critical technical hires and growing into retained leadership and executive mandates as relationships deepen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every hire is treated as a commercial, risk and governance decision. We map the market properly, test for depth, and only introduce people we would be comfortable putting in front of a regulator, board or owner.

          <h2>Aviation, aerospace &amp; complex engineering</h2>
          <p>
            We focus on organisations where downtime, safety and regulation sit at the centre of the P&amp;L. Most work is UK &amp; Europe, with mandates typically sponsored by COOs, CEOs, Accountable Managers, Heads of Maintenance and Heads of Engineering.

            The labels below are a guide rather than a hard boundary. If you run an asset-heavy, safety-critical operation and the stakes are high when things stop, we are in the right territory.

            We keep mandate volume intentionally low. Every search is founder-led, research-backed and run with the discipline you would expect from a law firm or advisory boutique – so a COO, CEO, Head of Maintenance or Head of Engineering can defend the process in front of a board, regulator or owner.

          <p>
            Our process is built for regulated, asset-heavy environments where the cost of a bad hire is measured in more than recruitment fees. We work the way you expect your own teams to operate as a COO, CEO, Head of Maintenance or Head of Engineering: disciplined, documented and with clear, low-noise communication throughout.

          <p>
            Averdon Partners is founder-led. The firm was built by an aerospace engineering graduate with hands-on experience in aeronautical maintenance and a defined route into aviation and asset-finance law.

            <p class="founder-highlight">
              That mix of hangar-floor exposure and legal training is the filter on every search: we read technical documentation, understand maintenance and operational constraints, and think in terms of contracts, liability and governance – not just CVs.
            </p>
            <p>
              For clients, that means a search partner who can sit beside you as COO, CEO, Head of Maintenance or Head of Engineering and bridge conversations between engineering, operations, finance and legal. We pay attention to approvals, safety cases, SLAs and regulatory relationships – the things that actually keep you awake at night.
            </p>
            <p>
              For candidates, it means dealing with someone who understands the reality of technical and operational roles, the stress that comes with accountable positions, and the career paths that sit behind them. We are interested in long-term trajectories, not quick wins.
            </p>
            <p class="founder-footnote">
              A fuller founder profile will sit here in due course. For now, the focus is simple: do excellent work, mandate by mandate, and earn the right to be in the room when the next critical hire comes around.
