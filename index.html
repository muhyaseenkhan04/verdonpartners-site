          <h2>Search for regulated, safety-critical environments</h2>
          <p>
            Averdon Partners exists for organisations where a senior hire is not “just recruitment”, but a decision about risk, resilience and reputation. Our work is concentrated in aviation, aerospace, engineering and MRO – sectors where downtime is expensive, regulators are close and stakeholders are unforgiving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typical sponsors include COOs, CEOs, Accountable Managers, Heads of Maintenance and Heads of Engineering who need a shortlist they can defend in front of a board, a regulator or an owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            From senior engineers and maintenance leaders through to group-level technical and operations directors, we focus on roles in airlines, MROs, OEMs and infrastructure operators where a bad appointment quickly becomes a board, regulator or owner conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are most often engaged when:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Fleet growth, programme pressure or utilisation is exposing gaps in leadership or technical depth</li>
            <li>Regulators, lessors or investors are asking harder questions about safety, reliability or governance</li>
            <li>Existing recruitment channels are delivering CVs, but not people who can actually carry the risk</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For every mandate we:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Treat the brief as a commercial and risk case, not a shopping list of requirements</li>
            <li>Map the market properly before committing to a shortlist or approaching candidates</li>
            <li>Test depth, behaviour and operating context – not just titles, logos and job tenure</li>
            <li>Only introduce people you would be comfortable putting in front of a regulator, board or owner</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Search across aviation, aerospace &amp; complex engineering</h2>
          <p>
            We focus on asset-heavy, safety-critical and regulated operations where engineering, maintenance and operations sit close to the value-creation line. Most work is in the UK and Europe, with selective international mandates where our network and expertise are relevant.

          <p>
            The sectors below are a guide rather than a hard boundary. If an outage, an AOG event or a system failure immediately becomes a board conversation, we are operating in the right territory.

            <p>
              We run low-volume, founder-led searches for critical technical and leadership roles. Each mandate is scoped around risk, regulation and commercial impact, with structured research and market-mapping agreed before outreach. The output is a small, defensible shortlist – not a stack of CVs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alongside search, we provide straightforward advisory input on role design, reporting lines, succession and market realities, so that the mandate and the shortlist are aligned with your operating environment and risk appetite.

            <p>
              We work with experienced technical and operational leaders in aviation, aerospace and asset-heavy industries. The focus is on long-term trajectories rather than quick moves: we care about the operating environments you thrive in, the responsibility you want to carry next and the risk you are prepared to own.

          <h2>Low-volume, research-led, founder-driven search</h2>
          <p>
            Our search and advisory process is built for regulated, asset-heavy environments where the cost of a bad hire is measured in more than recruitment fees. We work the way you expect your own teams to operate: disciplined, documented and with clear, low-noise communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            The firm is led by an aerospace engineering graduate with hands-on maintenance exposure and a strong grounding in contracts, liability and governance. That mix of technical literacy and legal awareness shapes how we take a brief, challenge it and represent you in the market.

              We start with your operating reality: fleet, assets, regulatory exposure, stakeholder expectations and internal politics. The brief is framed around risk and outcomes, not only responsibilities and reporting lines.

            <p>
              We build a structured view of the market: where the right people sit, how they are measured, and what would move them. Target lists and priorities are agreed with you before outreach begins, so effort is focused where it matters.

              Candidates are assessed against technical depth, leadership behaviour and fit with your operating environment. You see a concise, defensible shortlist with clear commentary – not a long list of loosely-screened profiles.
